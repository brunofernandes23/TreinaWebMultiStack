ðŸ’» **_Front End_** ðŸ’»

> In the Front End stage, React was used with Next to style the site, where all the styling and layout of the project was defined using React hooks.

ðŸ“·Print from the working site, you can access the project by downloading the zip and using the _npm run dev_ command to open localhost:3000ðŸ“·:

ðŸ—ƒ **_Back End_** ðŸ—ƒ

> In the Back End step, the option was given to choose between PHP, Python and Java, using the frameworks, Laravel, Django and Spring. I chose Python/Django, it's the language I chose and I'm loving learning. With Django a CRUD was created where it was possible to register the day workers of the project, being able to edit or remove them. I learned how to create an API, which was used to join the Front End and Back End.

ðŸ“· Print of the running CRUD, can be executed from inside venv, in the path _\treinawebmultistack\ediaristas-backend\ediaristas_workshop_, once in the path, just run the command '_python manage.py runserver_ **will only work inside venv** which will open the *http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/cadastrar_diarista* ðŸ“·:

ðŸ“² **_Mobile_** ðŸ“²

> On mobile, React Native was used to make the application and Expo to visualize the development of the project.

ðŸ“· Print from the app running on the device. Just open the folder and run the command #expo start ðŸ“·:
